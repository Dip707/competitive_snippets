# competitive-snippets README


## Features

**Basic Template:**
> **Command:** ```!!basics```

> This command will copy the basic template with headers and macros famously used in competitive programming. Sections may be added/removed in the future on the basis of use in competitive programming.

**Segment Trees:**
> **Command:** ```!!max_seg_tree```

> Currently only one snippet available for segment tree which provide snippet for building, updating and querying segment tree with lazy propogation.

**Disjoint Set Unions:**
> **Command:** ```!!dsu```

> This command will import code for basic disjoint set unions (also known as union-finds) with rank and parent vectors included.

**Depth First Search- Basic:**
> **Command:** ```!!dfs-basic```

> This command will import code for basic depth first search in graph.

**Breadth First Search- Basic:**
> **Command:** ```!!bfs-basic```

> This command will import code for basic Breadth first search in graph.

**Kruskal**
> **Command:** ```!!krushkal```

> This command will import code for basic code for Krushkal Algorithm which calculates minimum cost spanning tree for a graph in $O(Elog(E))$.

## Requirements

This is solo project and no requirements are there so far.
<!-- ## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something -->
